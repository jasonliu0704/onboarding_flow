## user signup verification

We need a phone number based user signup verification flow.

pick an existing or create React native screens to:
screen1: enter phone number and send verification code
screen2: input received code to verify

we will generate simple random digits to send over message to user's phone and once received, verify against the code we sent.

api use to send code: Mobile text messaging (SMS) - Amazon Simple Notification Service
you can use the sanbox to try the api: SMS sandbox - Amazon Simple Notification Service

please create a github repo for this.
