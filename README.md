## user signup verification

We need a phone number based user signup verification flow.

pick an existing or create React native screens to:
screen1: enter phone number and send verification code 
screen2: input received code to verify

we will generate simple random digits to send over message to user's phone and once received, verify against the code we sent.

you can use the sanbox to try the api: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html
